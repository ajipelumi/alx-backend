## Caching

This repository contains the code and resources for learning about caching in backend development.

**Caching** is a technique for storing copies of frequently accessed data in a faster storage medium.
This is useful for improving the performance of applications that access the same data repeatedly.

### Topics Covered

- **Caching** - We learnt about caching and how to implement it in a backend application.

- **FIFO Caching** - We learnt about FIFO caching and its implementation in a backend application.

- **LIFO Caching** - We learnt about LIFO caching and its implementation in a backend application.

- **LRU Caching** - We learnt about LRU caching and its implementation in a backend application.

- **MRU Caching** - We learnt about MRU caching and its implementation in a backend application.

- **LFU Caching** - We learnt about LFU caching and its implementation in a backend application.

- **Caching Purpose** - We learnt about the purpose of caching among which are:

  - **Reduce Latency** - Caching reduces latency by reducing the number of requests to the main data store.

  - **Reduce Database Load** - Caching reduces the load on the main data store by reducing the number of requests to it.

  - **Reduce Bandwidth Usage** - Caching reduces bandwidth usage by reducing the number of requests to the main data store.

  - **Reduce Server Load** - Caching reduces the load on the server by reducing the number of requests to it.

  - **Reduce Costs** - Caching reduces costs by reducing the number of requests to the main data store.

- **Caching Limitations** - We learnt about the limitations of caching among which are:

  - **Stale Data** - Caching can lead to stale data if the data in the main data store is updated.

  - **Cache Invalidation** - Caching can lead to cache invalidation issues if the data in the main data store is updated.

  - **Cache Eviction** - Caching can lead to cache eviction issues if the cache is full and new data needs to be added to it.

  - **Cache Stampede** - Caching can lead to cache stampede issues if the cache is empty and new data needs to be added to it.

  - **Cache Poisoning** - Caching can lead to cache poisoning issues if the cache is poisoned with malicious data.

  - **Cache Locking** - Caching can lead to cache locking issues if the cache is locked by a malicious user.

  - **Cache Warming** - Caching can lead to cache warming issues if the cache is not warmed up before use.

  - **Cache Churn** - Caching can lead to cache churn issues if the cache is not used frequently.

  - **Cache Consistency** - Caching can lead to cache consistency issues if the cache is not kept up to date.
