## i18n

This repository contains the code and resources for learning about internationalization and localization in backend development.

**Internationalization** is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.

**Localization** is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text.

### Topics Covered

- **Internationalization** - We learnt about internationalization and how to implement it in a backend application.

- **Localization** - We learnt about localization and how to implement it in a backend application.

- **pytz** - We learnt about pytz and how to use it to handle timezones in a backend application.

- **Flask-Babel** - We learnt about Flask-Babel and how to use it to handle internationalization and localization in a Flask application.
